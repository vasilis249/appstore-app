// Before `cap sync ios`: small patches to native plugins (pinned versions; each patch is idempotent).
// 1. @capacitor-community/background-geolocation 1.2.26 declares capacitor-swift-pm `from: "7.0.0"` (= 7.x only in
//    SPM), which can't resolve next to the app's exact 8.5.2. The Swift code itself works with Capacitor 8.
// 2. Same plugin: if the user turned off "Precise Location" (iOS 14+ reduced accuracy, fixes off by kilometres), ask
//    iOS for temporary full accuracy like Find My does (purpose key "SpeakMap" in Info.plist
//    NSLocationTemporaryUsageDescriptionDictionary). Only asked once the app is authorized. The plugin targets iOS 13,
//    so the iOS 14 API sits behind `#available` (an older patch without it is upgraded in place).
